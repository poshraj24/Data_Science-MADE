# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Diabetes Risk in an Individual.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Can we use a subset of the risk factors to accurately predict whether an individual has diabetes?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Understanding the individual risk for developing diabetes is crucial for preventative healthcare. Diabetes affects millions worldwide, and early identification of risk factors can significantly improve outcomes. This project aims to develop a user-friendly tool that empowers individuals to assess their personal risk. By analyzing demographic data, lifestyle factors, and family history, the tool will provide personalized insights and potentially motivate proactive health management. We anticipate that this project will contribute to raising awareness and promoting early intervention in the fight against diabetes.
