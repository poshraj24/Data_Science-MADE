# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Unveiling the Climate Crisis: A Data Science Investigation of Global Warming Trends and Solutions

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How did global warming start to peak and how can it be controlled?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project aims to leverage data science techniques to analyze global warming trends and evaluate the effectiveness of potential solutions. By employing a range of statistical and machine learning methods, we will investigate the relationship between various factors (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, land use changes, solar radiation) and observed temperature increases. We will also model the potential impact of different mitigation strategies (e.g., renewable energy adoption, carbon capture technologies, reforestation) on future climate scenarios. This research has the potential to provide valuable insights for policymakers, scientists, and the general public, informing evidence-based decision-making in the face of the climate crisis.
